Objective> <Bug Bounty Hunting>  
why> I found that it matches my life style, It's a cool job the ability to hack ethicaly someone and they pay you, it depende on your ability and your potencial nothing would cover your potencial if you put in the work it will reword you (you should work very very very HARD),
Background> 
Networkin :I read the comptia network+ by Mike meyers and did the first 20% of David Bombel course in Udemy,   
Coding : I did the Python courses and The OOP course also By CodeCademy and also The Boot.dev platform 
Web Devlopement : I did the Javascript course in boot.dev and CodeCademy and basic HTML & CSS in CodeCademy and Dr Angela Yu in Udemy 
Plan> I should finish the Odin Project so i get my hand durty i see that my hand are clean from codeing i know how to solve platform ploblems but i can't do project something that i can bring to reality so i decided to start the Odin project and try to learn every thing to build project while learning what CodeCadem offer i think that the combination of these 2 is so much good one offer you the knowledge and the other show you where you can practice and whit what prerequisit the OTP tell you that after finishing some concept in HTML & CSS you should do this project and CodeCademy teach you those concept so i think it's a good match.
    While i m doing the OTP i will buy TCM securty course of ethical hacking & linux and windows privilages escalation & Active Diractory hacking and learn some basic hacking then go to tryhackme and hackthebox to try to solve some boxes or even buy some courses in Hackthebox Academy, then after finishing the OTP  hacking basics i will learn web pentesting and focus on 2 or 3 hacks that i will choose and deepdive in there learning and learn webrecon from good hackers then i will go to real platforms
